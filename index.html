            <p class="sectionsubtag">With the emergence and spread of COVID-19 in India, online education has trickled
                down to the most basic level — schools and colleges! When asked about their experience with online
                teaching, a student from a college in Bengaluru said, ​“The online option is a need in this pandemic
                situation. It has brought education to us without us going anywhere, and it is more flexible”. Probably,
                students are finding it a welcome change from strict schedules and long-distance commutes to attend
                classes. For some others, who find learning in large classes intimidating, this may be a less stressful
                option. Many teachers are making the best of this situation by exploring new methods of teaching and
                assessment.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag">With educational institutes closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government has
                been encouraging online education to achieve academic continuity. Most high-end private and public
                institutions have made the switch smoothly using online platforms such as Zoom, Google classrooms,
                Microsoft teams, etc., while many still find it a herculean task. The challenges of online education are
                multifaceted. It is time that we Indians, as a society, understand the realms of online education – in
                India, for India. </p>
